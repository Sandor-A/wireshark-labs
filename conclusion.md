# Conclusions and Key Learnings

## Overview
These Wireshark labs were conducted to build foundational SOC Level 1 skills in network traffic analysis, documentation, and investigative thinking.

## Key Learnings
- Understanding baseline network behavior is critical before identifying anomalies
- Display filters are essential for reducing noise and focusing on relevant traffic
- Not all unusual traffic is malicious and must be validated carefully
- Documentation is a key part of the SOC investigation process

## SOC-Level Takeaways
From a SOC Level 1 perspective, these labs reinforced the importance of:
- structured analysis workflows
- clear documentation of findings
- escalation when indicators require deeper investigation
- avoiding assumptions without sufficient evidence

## Skills Developed
- Network traffic analysis using Wireshark
- Identification of basic suspicious indicators
- Defensive and blue-team mindset
- Incident triage and investigation fundamentals

## Next Steps
Planned improvements include:
- analyzing additional capture files
- correlating network findings with logs
- expanding analysis to include threat intelligence indicators

## Final Note
This work was completed as part of ongoing SOC Level 1 training and hands-on learning.
